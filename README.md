Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is about building software (apps, websites, games) in a structured way. It's important because:

It makes software work correctly and run smoothly.
It helps teams work together and finish projects on time.
It makes software safe from hackers.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Handling Complexity – Breaking big programs into smaller, easy-to-manage parts.
Improving Processes – Using step-by-step methods (like Agile) to build software faster.
Advancing Technology – Better programming languages, tools, and automation.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – What should we build?
Requirements – What features should it have?
Design – How will it look and work?
Coding – Writing the actual program.
Testing – Checking for bugs and fixing them.
Deployment – Releasing it to users.
Maintenance – Updating and fixing issues over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a step-by-step method where each phase is completed before moving to the next, making it best for projects with fixed requirements, like banking systems. Agile is flexible, allowing continuous improvements and regular feedback, making it ideal for evolving projects like mobile apps. Waterfall is rigid, while Agile adapts to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes the code.
QA Engineer – Tests the software for bugs.
Project Manager – Keeps everything on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) – A program like VS Code that helps you write, test, and debug code.
Version Control (Git) – A tool that saves different versions of your code so you don’t lose work and can track changes.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
problem
Software is too complex 
solution
Break it into smaller parts.

problem
Tight deadlines
solution
Use Agile to work in small steps

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Testing small parts of the code.
Integration Testing – Checking if different parts work together.
System Testing – Making sure the whole software works.
Acceptance Testing – Ensuring users are happy with it.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is about giving clear instructions to AI so it gives good answers.

Why is it useful?

Helps AI understand what you want.
Makes AI more helpful and accurate.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
bad
"Write a book."
good
"Write a book about a cat who fell inlove with a bird in summer land."

Why is the good prompt better?
 More specific (characters,background)
  Helps AI understand exactly what to do
